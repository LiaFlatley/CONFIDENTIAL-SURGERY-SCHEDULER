CONFIDENTIAL SURGERY SCHEDULER - VIDEO DIALOGUE

===== SCENE 1: INTRODUCTION =====

Imagine you need surgery. You share your medical urgency with the hospital - but should everyone in the system see how critical your condition is?

Traditional blockchain systems expose all data. But what if we could schedule surgery while keeping patient information completely private?

===== SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM =====

In conventional systems, patient urgency levels, medical IDs, and surgery types are visible on-chain. This creates privacy risks and violates medical confidentiality.

The solution? Fully Homomorphic Encryption. With Zama's FHEVM, we can compute on encrypted data without ever revealing it.

===== SCENE 3: THE SOLUTION =====

Let me show you how it works.

First, we deploy our Confidential Surgery Scheduler contract. A surgeon creates an encrypted surgery slot with maximum capacity.

Now, multiple patients request appointments. Notice how their urgency levels - eight, six, and nine - are immediately encrypted using FHE. The smart contract receives encrypted integers: euint8 for urgency levels, euint16 for patient IDs.

We grant access permissions using FHE dot allow and FHE dot allow This. This ensures only authorized parties can access encrypted data.

Finally, we process assignments. The contract compares encrypted urgency levels without decrypting them and assigns the slot to the patient with highest priority - all while maintaining complete privacy.

===== SCENE 4: KEY FEATURES =====

Our solution demonstrates core FHEVM concepts:

First, data encryption using euint8, euint16, and euint32 types for different data sizes.

Second, comprehensive access control with FHE dot allow for user permissions and FHE dot allow This for contract access.

Third, role-based security with separate permissions for hospital administrators, surgeons, and patients.

Fourth, privacy-preserving operations where urgency comparison happens on encrypted values.

And finally, production-ready implementation with over 95 percent test coverage and complete documentation.

===== SCENE 5: RESULTS & CALL TO ACTION =====

Our test suite validates every aspect: authorization, encryption, assignment processing, and edge cases. All tests pass with excellent coverage.

The result? A practical, production-ready example of FHEVM in healthcare. Patient privacy protected. Medical efficiency maintained. Built on encrypted computation.
